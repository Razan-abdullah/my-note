**Hello!** I'm ###Razan beginner software developer trying to improve my knowldge and skills to become profissional .


**breif of the good advice to the devs**
We should understand the purpose of the software which is  To help people.
Developers who cannot conceive the purpose of the software will write bad software.
*What is bad software?* A complex system that doesn’t help people that much.When software is hard to create or modify, developers spend most of their time focusing on making things “just work,” and less time focusing on helping users. The design of software aims to make developers job as easy as possible so they can focus on what matters. You will create software that will help users and your software will continue to help them for a long time.Developers who don’t fully understand their work tend to develop complex systems. It can become a vicious cycle: misunderstanding leads to complexity, which leads to further misunderstanding, and so on.
